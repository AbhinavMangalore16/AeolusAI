# AeolusAI - Weather Forecast & Prediction Dashboard
Why the name **“Aeolus”**?

Because he is the Greek god of wind — and who better to trust with weather forecasts than the guy literally in charge of the skies?
## 🌤️ Overview
A sleek weather dashboard that combines real-time forecast data and a trained ML model (for precipitation and temperature prediction along with a classification for the weather) to deliver 5-day weather insights.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Real-time weather forecast using OpenWeatherMap API
- ML-based precipitation prediction pipeline (logged using MLflow)
- Responsive and clean dashboard UI
- Model performance tracked and registered with MLflow

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + Tailwind
- Backend (DS): Random Forest, XGBoost, GBRT (via scikit-learn), MLflow, Python
- Data Source: OpenWeatherMap API
- Deployment: Vercel, Cron [(deployed here)](https://aeolus-ai.vercel.app/)

## 🔍 ML Approach
- Model: Regression for precipitation and temperature; Classifier for the weather (cloudy, sunny, rain, etc.)
- Trained on historical weather data
- MAE/RMSE/R² logged via MLflow
